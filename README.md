# Move-Sui-Gas-Optimization-Patterns
Here, we store code used to test potential strategies for gas optimization in the Move language (2024 release)

Using code like this, our team developed principles capable of reducing gas costs by up to 83% of gas fees.

We used the Move Studio IDE: https://www.movestudio.dev/

Along with the Move Book: https://move-book.com/index.html

And, SuiVision to see results on the Sui blockchain: https://suivision.xyz/
